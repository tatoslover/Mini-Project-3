- [ ] New site created from Git repository
- [ ] Repository connected to Netlify
- [ ] Build settings configured:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `frontend`
  - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

### Step 3: Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
Set these in Netlify Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` = `mongodb+srv://samuelwelove:vnIsLznxJuBWeznE@iodmp3portfolio.2sjhs9u.mongodb.net/puphub?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=IODMP3Portfolio`

- [ ] Verify deployment success
- [ ] Test all endpoints

## Post-Deployment Testing

### üîç Health Check
Test: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health`

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Barkend API",
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    "type": "MongoDB Atlas"
  }
}
```

### üêï API Endpoints Testing
- [ ] **GET** `/.netlify/functions/health` - Health check
- [ ] **GET** `/.netlify/functions/breeds` - Get all breeds
- [ ] **GET** `/.netlify/functions/random` - Get random dog
- [ ] **GET** `/.netlify/functions/stats` - Get statistics
- [ ] **POST** `/.netlify/functions/favorites` - Add to favorites
- [ ] **GET** `/.netlify/functions/swagger-spec` - API documentation

### üåê Frontend Testing
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] API calls from frontend work
- [ ] CORS headers working properly
- [ ] All images and assets load
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### üìä Database Testing
- [ ] MongoDB connection successful
- [ ] Data can be read from database
- [ ] Data can be written to database
- [ ] Collections created automatically
- [ ] Indexes working properly

## Troubleshooting Guide

### ‚ùå Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. MongoDB Connection Failed
**Error:** `Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster`
**Solution:** 
- [ ] Check IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Verify connection string
- [ ] Check database user permissions

#### 2. Function Timeout
**Error:** `Task timed out after 10.00 seconds`
**Solution:**
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Check connection pooling
- [ ] Verify Atlas cluster is active

#### 3. Environment Variables Not Found
**Error:** `MONGODB_URI environment variable is not defined`
**Solution:**
- [ ] Check variable names in Netlify
- [ ] Redeploy after adding variables
- [ ] Verify variable values

#### 4. CORS Errors
**Error:** `Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy`
**Solution:**
- [ ] Check CORS headers in functions
- [ ] Verify netlify.toml configuration
- [ ] Test with different origins

### üîß Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Netlify environment variables
netlify env:list

# Test function locally
netlify functions:invoke health

# View function logs
netlify functions:logs

# Local development server
netlify dev
```

## Performance Optimization

### üöÄ Production Optimizations
- [ ] Database indexes created for frequent queries
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Minified assets

### üìà Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Netlify Analytics enabled
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas monitoring configured
- [ ] Error logging implemented
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked

## Security Checklist

### üîí Security Measures
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in client
- [ ] IP whitelisting configured (production)
- [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (handled by Netlify)
- [ ] Input validation in all functions
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices
- [ ] Regular credential rotation
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

## Go-Live Checklist

### üéØ Final Steps
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Security measures in place
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

### üìã Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor function invocations
- [ ] Check error rates
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Track user analytics
- [ ] Monitor costs (Atlas/Netlify)

## Emergency Procedures

### üö® If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Check Status Pages:**
   - Netlify Status: https://status.netlify.com/
   - MongoDB Atlas Status: https://status.cloud.mongodb.com/

2. **Quick Rollback:**
